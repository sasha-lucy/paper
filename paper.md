# Introduction
We present measurements of recent depressive symptoms and cortical volume.

Cortical volume used the IDPs from UK Biobank (Johns et al. 2004).

# Simulations blah blah

# Methodology
We compared our measurements with a mdoel simulation.
The model is detail in Millward et al. (2005).

# Results  
The simulations indicate bah blah

# Figures 
Figures go in their own section

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into...
Nontheless, ....
